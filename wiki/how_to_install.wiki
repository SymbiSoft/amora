= Software installing instructions: Amora 1.0 =

== Cellphone client ==
=== If you have Python installed ===

Simply download and install amora-version.sis to your cellphone. Assuming that
you had sent the file to your cellphone using bluetooth as a message:

http://amora.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/install01.jpg


Selecting it will display the questions: Install Amora: assistant?

http://amora.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/install02.jpg


Select Yes. Then it will display a security warning (its fine, choose continue
in the screens bellow)

Of course you can send the SIS file to cellphone in several different ways too
(using USB cable, copying to memory card, etc) and later select it using the
S60 file browser.

If in early  steps of installing you see this image dialog

http://amora.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/without01.jpg

this means that you *don't* have Python installed. Just advance to next section
where you can find instructions.


=== If you DONT have Python installed ===

Download the file amora-version-deps.sis to you cellphone. It has Python
(required dependency) and Python Scriptshell (optional) bundled together with
Amora client for Nokia S60 smartphones.

Just follow through the screens selecting *continue*, as bellow:

== PC server ==

=== Debian/Ubuntu users ===

Just download and install the debian package. To install, run in a terminal:

$sudo dpkg -i amora-server-version.deb

And if it installed fine, you should be able to start the server running a
terminal:

$amorad


=== Installing from source ===

==== Software dependencies ====

For server side, to compile the source code, you will need:

  * gcc compiler
  * Xlibs
  * XTest libs
  * BlueZ libs
  * Imlib2 libs

And also XTest extension enabled in you X server (default on Ubuntu). So,
in Ubuntu simply run in your terminal:

$sudo apt-get install gcc libxext-dev libbluetooth2-dev libimlib2-dev libxtst-dev


==== Installing ====

After installing the dependencies, extract server app tarball with:

$ tar -zxvf amora_server-0.x.tar.gz

where _x_ is the *current* download version.

Change to the extracted directory and execute the following commands:

$mkdir build

$cd build

$../configure

$make

It will generate an executable file named 'amora', you must
start the application (and make sure that the bluetooth dongle is
connected to the computer):

$./amorad
