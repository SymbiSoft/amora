= Software installing instructions =

== Software dependencies ==
To run the application, you need to install Python for S60 in your cellphone, available in
[http://pys60.sourceforge.net PyS60]. There are 2 files required, the python
interpreter and the python shell, you need to download them and install
to be able to execute python programs in your cellphone.

To install the cellphone client application, just copy the files in a folder
named 'Python' in cellphone memory card.

For server side, to compile the source code, you will need:

  * gcc compiler
  * Xlibs
  * XTest libs
  * BlueZ libs
  * Imlib2 libs

And also XTest extension enabled in you X server (default on Ubuntu). So,
in Ubuntu simply run in your terminal:

$sudo apt-get install gcc libxext-dev libbluetooth2-dev libimlib2-dev libxtst-dev

After installing the dependencies, extract server app tarball with:

$ tar -zxvf amora_server-0.x.tar.gz 

where _x_ is the *current* download version.

Change to the extracted directory and execute the following commands:

$mkdir build

$cd build

$../configure

$make

It will generate an executable file named 'amora', you must
start the application (and make sure that the bluetooth dongle is
connected to the computer):

$./amora


== Repository version ==

If you checked out the code from repository, you need first to generate the build system scripts. This one requires autotools packages (automake, etc).

You first run in the directory pc_server:

$ autoreconf -i --force

and then just follow previous instructions for tarball version.
