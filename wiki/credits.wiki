Amora server benefited directly or indirectly from code of following projects: BlueZ (sdptool), Erich Kitzmuller a.k.a. ammoQ ([http://download.ammoq.com/ xjoypad]), Albert Huang (author of [http://people.csail.mit.edu/albert/bluez-intro/ An introduction to Bluetooth Programming]). Makoto Sugano contributed a patch to enable continuous keypressing.

Amora client was only possible thanks to the great tutorials written by Jurgen Scheible, the better place to start learning Python for S60. [http://www.mobilenin.com/pys60/menu.htm link]
