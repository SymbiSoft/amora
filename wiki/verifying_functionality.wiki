= Introduction =

This is thought as testing procedure to make sure that amora is working
correctly after changes to the code have been made.

= Basic usage =
== Bluetooth not found ==
  * Make sure the Bluetooth dongle is not plugged in. (If it's internal try to go into aircraft mode. If that's not available, go to _Starting the server_.)
  * Start amorad. It should say
{{{
No bluetooth device/dongle available. Aborting...
}}}
  and exit with return code 255. You can check that by typing
{{{
echo $?
}}}
  immediately afterwards.
== Starting the server ==
  * Plug in the Bluetooth dongle if not already plugged in. Make sure that the appropriate drivers are loaded, e.g. by calling
{{{
lsmod
}}}
  * Start amorad again. It should say
{{{
Initialization done, waiting cellphone connection...
Entering main loop...
}}}
