	* amora-server/debian/changelog:
	  Updating Debian package version.

2008-01-04 17:10  cavalcantii

	* amora-server/configure.ac:
	  Updating Amora server version number.

2008-01-04 01:35  cavalcantii

	* amora_descr.t2t:
	  Updating feature list and project ideas.

2008-01-03 21:14  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/helpwindow.py:
	  Setting help text color to fit with 'Amora' theme.

2008-01-03 20:59  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/data/keymap_help.txt, amora-client/data/start_help.txt:
	  Moving help contents of connected state to a new file (currently, not
	  used).
	  
	  The graphical keymaping already supplies the information of function x
	  key.

2008-01-03 17:06  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py, amora-client/libs/configure.py:
	  Adding a configuration option to change mouse pointer moving delta.

2008-01-03 16:32  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/amora.py, amora-client/libs/application.py:
	  Adding credit where its due.

2008-01-03 16:28  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py:
	  I decided to decrease the mouse pointer moving delta as a workaround
	  for
	  added speed in Amora client when it runs as a standalone application
	  (installed with a SIS file).
	  
	  I think it would be nice to add an option in configuration screen to
	  control the delta value.

2008-01-03 01:27  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/amora.py, amora-client/libs/application.py:
	  Adding code to support time based continuous keypress, contribution
	  from Makoto Sugano.

2008-01-02 22:38  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/amora.py:
	  Library loading path function now scans for a new directory
	  (Drive:\Private\UID\) as also for a new main app file ('default.py').
	  
	  Those changes were required to generate a SIS file with Amora client.
	  
	  This commit closes issue 10: SIS packaging of cellphone client.

2007-12-31 00:22  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py:
	  Adding code to change menu options when in 'started' mode to control
	  the
	  stopwatch. Now the user can reset and toggle the stopwatch.
	  
	  I think that this nails the issue number 6:
	  "Integrate stopwatch in display"

2007-12-30 20:04  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/stopwatch.py:
	  Adding a new function to create a submenu list with callbacks to
	  control
	  stopwatch behaviour.

2007-12-30 06:08  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py, amora-client/libs/configure.py:
	  Adding a option list in 'configure' class to enable user definition of
	  sleep time when in 'autoscreen' mode (i.e. the time to wait to ask for
	  a
	  screenshot after a mouse click).
	  
	  This commit closes the issue 27:
	  "Add a timeout to wait to take screenshot when in autoscreen mode"
	  
	  This make usage of 'autoscreen' mode more flexible.

2007-12-30 04:58  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py, amora-client/libs/configure.py:
	  Adding a widget to control displaying (or not...) of stopwatch as also
	  the logic in main application.
	  Now the user can select if he/she wishes to display the stopwatch.

2007-12-30 04:10  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/stopwatch.py:
	  A pack of changes... I started working to spruce up the code and when
	  I
	  finished, I had already made the following changes:
	  
	  - changed stopwatch.update function interface: it only receives the
	  Canvas parameter now;
	  - moved clock positioning control variables as internal member class
	  variables
	  - added new member functions to reset the stopwatch counter, blanking
	  area
	  when redrawing the clock numbers and finally the position of clock
	  
	  Those changes were required for me to test the stopwatch in 3
	  different device
	  models probing the better parameter values for positioning and
	  blanking area
	  (for redrawing the numbers).
	  
	  Advantages of the changes: with the clock 'alive', you can change:
	  - positioning
	  - blanking area
	  - toggle (pause/continue)
	  - reset the counter.
	  
	  TODO: add client GUI menu options to control the stopwatch.

2007-12-29 03:46  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py, amora-client/libs/stopwatch.py:
	  Changing the stopwatch class to work with external resources (i.e.
	  Canvas object) and integrating it to main application class.
	  
	  It still have some issues to be worked out (e.g. user should be
	  capable
	  of stopping/starting the stopwatch) but the whole thing turned out to
	  be
	  much easier than I first predicted.

2007-12-28 23:00  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py:
	  I decided to move the code that loads the keymap background image to a
	  distinct function, since this screen is displayed in different
	  contexts.
	  
	  This commit closes issue number 29 (Display keyboard mapping on
	  connected).

2007-12-28 22:37  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py:
	  Cleaning up function calls for application.presentationdisplay()
	  function member.
	  
	  I'm planing to center application background image displaying around
	  the aforementioned method (when its possible).

2007-12-27 22:31  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/libs/application.py:
	  To handle multiple cellphone correctly (where each client can use a
	  different
	  screenshot orientation), Amora client needs to inform the server
	  *each* time it
	  asks for a screenshot.
	  
	  This commit fixes issue number 35.

2007-12-27 22:28  cavalcantii

	* amora-client/amora.py:
	  In my last commits (related with changing naming convention) I forgot
	  to change the code that scans for main application file trying to
	  locate
	  where is the libraries used by Amora client.
	  
	  This commit fixes the client (everything seems to work fine now).

2007-12-27 21:15  cavalcantii

	* amora-server/debian, amora-server/debian/changelog,
	  amora-server/debian/compat, amora-server/debian/control,
	  amora-server/debian/dirs, amora-server/debian/rules:
	  Adding patch to generate Debian package (tested in Ubuntu 7.10),
	  contribution from Tomaz Noleto.
	  
	  This closes issue number 11 from amora bug tracking.

2007-12-21 12:56  cavalcantii

	* amora-client, amora-server, cell-client, pc-server:
	  Last naming commit (I hope this nails the whole issue).

2007-12-21 12:30  cavalcantii

	* pc-server/Makefile.am, pc-server/configure.ac:
	  I think this is the last naming convention related commit (uffs!).

2007-12-21 12:28  cavalcantii

	* cell-client/amora.py, cell-client/presenter.py:
	  Renaming client application file (following a better naming
	  convention).

2007-12-21 12:24  cavalcantii

	* cell-client, cell_client, pc-server, pc_server:
	  Renaming directory structure to a more standard naming convention
	  (it seems that it will make the packaging easier).

2007-12-19 00:36  tmpsantos

	* pc_server/src/bluecode.h, pc_server/src/loop.c, pc_server/src/loop.h,
	  pc_server/src/main.c, pc_server/src/x11_event.h:
	  Typo.

2007-12-18 18:39  tmpsantos

	* pc_server/Makefile.am, pc_server/src/loop.c, pc_server/src/loop.h,
	  pc_server/src/main.c:
	  Merged branch:
	  
	  https://amora.googlecode.com/svn/branches/pc_server-hal -r 280:305
	  
	  
	  Note:
	  
	  This merging was manually (argh!) edited to merge only new main loop
	  code. All changes regarding HAL were discarded because HAL bluetooth
	  dongle detection isn't portable enough. The dongle wasn't detected
	  if you aren't using Debian Etch or upgrade your kernel.
	  
	  I will try another approach using the same idea of Gnome Bluetooth
	  Applet: DBUS + bluetooth daemon notifications. In this way, seens to
	  work in every environment.

2007-12-12 13:47  cavalcantii

	* cell_client/libs/application.py, pc_server/src/x11_event.c:
	  Making mouse move with current relative cursor position (this fix
	  issue 15: Mouse pointer current position is ignored).
	  Contribution from Tomaz Noleto (welcome aboard, friend!).

2007-12-10 12:47  cavalcantii

	* pc_server/src/bluecode.h, pc_server/src/imscreen.h,
	  pc_server/src/log.h, pc_server/src/protocol.h,
	  pc_server/src/x11_event.h:
	  Updating the todos (comments must change together with the code).
	  I'm putting the remark for creation of unit tests because in near
	  future changes in the server architecture will require a track (the
	  tests)
	  to keep development under control.

2007-12-07 14:21  cavalcantii

	* pc_server/Makefile.am, pc_server/src/bluecode.c,
	  pc_server/src/bluecode.h, pc_server/src/linux.c:
	  Moving POSIX/C code to 'bluecode.c' file and keeping Linux only
	  code in linux.c
	  
	  This will help port of amora server to other *nix as also prevent
	  code duplication.

2007-12-06 17:57  cavalcantii

	* pc_server/src/linux.c:
	  Moving sendfile header include to conditional macro test (because
	  amora server is not using it anyway, and its blocking BSD port).

2007-12-05 16:11  tmpsantos

	* pc_server/src/main.c:
	  Now the user can see the version and build date of Amora Server as the
	  most of standard *nix applications.

2007-12-03 19:08  cavalcantii

	* pc_server/src/linux.c:
	  Fixing a missing variable initialization (thanks Thiago for
	  remembering it).

2007-12-03 17:43  cavalcantii

	* pc_server/src/bluecode.h, pc_server/src/linux.c, pc_server/src/main.c:
	  Adding checking for validity of *the default* bluetooth dongle
	  descriptor returned
	  by BlueZ (this narrows a race condition for dongle disconnection).
	  
	  I save the device number (i.e. hci0) in use by current bluetooth
	  socket (it will be
	  useful when HAL disconnection is implemented).

2007-12-02 23:57  tmpsantos

	* pc_server/src/main.c:
	  Added command line parameters support. By now only the logfile path
	  option is configurable. We aren't using getopt_long() because is a GNU
	  function and may difficult the porting for others architectures.

2007-11-20 02:46  cavalcantii

	* pc_server/src/x11_event.c:
	  Removing 'ftime' (which by the way is obsolete!) and using the more
	  standard compliant 'gettimeofday'.
	  Thanks Alan a.k.a Jumpi for the tip.

2007-11-14 01:04  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/src/main.c:
	  - minor cosmetics

2007-11-14 01:04  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/src/linux.c, pc_server/src/x11_event.c:
	  - remove include of log.h since we're not using it here

2007-11-14 01:03  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/src/log.c, pc_server/src/log.h:
	  - remove bogus fd variable from log_message()
	  - minor cleanups

2007-11-12 17:06  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/Makefile.am, pc_server/amora.spec:
	  - add amora.spec (should work in other distributions
	  besides Mandriva Linux - with minor build-requirement
	  changes)

2007-11-12 16:32  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/README:
	  - add a small note about the client

2007-11-12 16:31  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/src/main.c:
	  - Do not use a hardcoded filename on /tmp (it's a security vuln).
	  Instead,
	  use the current working dir (added a TODO note about mkdtemp(3)).

2007-11-12 13:33  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/amora.1:
	  - remove Vanderson's name from credits, the code he
	  contributed was not authored by him.

2007-11-11 23:29  cavalcantii

	* pc_server/src/log.c, pc_server/src/log.h:
	  Giving credit where its is due, deleting lammer.

2007-11-11 17:52  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/m4/auxdevel.m4:
	  - duu, -Wall and -W should also be enabled when --enable-warnings is
	  set :)
	  (bug introduced in one of my previous commits)

2007-11-11 17:42  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/src/main.c:
	  - set internal functions as static

2007-11-11 14:02  ademar.reis

	* cell_client/data/conn_help.txt:
	  - remove exec bits from .txt file, as I believe it was added
	  by mistake (please revert if this is some sort of bizarre
	  need on the mobile side) :-)

2007-11-11 13:56  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/src/log.c:
	  - log_build_resource() doesn't accept NULL as filename anymore. It
	  will now
	  return an error in such case (a log module should not decide where to
	  write a log, not to mention it was using a hardcoded /tmp/ file, which
	  is
	  a security vulnerability);
	  - fix return code of log_message()
	  - minor refactoring on some var names (some apparently were
	  wrong by accident)
	  - minor cosmetics
	  
	  (disclaimer: only the compilation was tested)

2007-11-11 13:51  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/src/main.c:
	  - set log filename inside main(), using just "amora.log", on the
	  current directory (log.c sets it to /tmp/amora.log if a name is
	  not set, which is dangerous)

2007-11-11 13:16  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/Makefile.am, pc_server/amora.1:
	  - add a manpage

2007-11-11 12:47  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/Makefile.am:
	  - fix vim modeline

2007-11-11 12:46  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/m4/auxdevel.m4:
	  - importing new auxdevel.m4 from upstream build-system template.
	  Changes from previous version:
	  o enable -W and -Wall by default
	  o minor doc changes about --enable-warnings

2007-11-11 12:36  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/configure.ac:
	  - fix configure.ac project version (it was set as 0.8). Using 0.9svn
	  until a new version is released, so that we don't get confused
	  with the already releases 0.9 version.

2007-11-11 12:33  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/Makefile.am:
	  - fix make distcheck:
	  o s/Doxyfile/Doxyfile.in/
	  o remove BUILD-FAQ which was deleted in a previous commit
	  - disable check in distcheck configure flags, since it's
	  not used in this project anyway

2007-11-11 12:29  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/BUILD-FAQ:
	  - remove BUILD-FAQ, since it's from the build-system template and is
	  intended for developers when trying to adapt it to their projects.

2007-11-11 12:27  ademar.reis

	* pc_server/README:
	  - fix README content (it was about the build-system template, not
	  amora). It's still far from complete, but better than before anyway.

2007-11-11 12:25  ademar.reis

	* cell_client/COPYING, pc_server/COPYING:
	  - fix bogus line (lots of spaces at beginning)
